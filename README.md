# SmartHotel360

During our **Connect(); 2017** event this year we presented beautiful Xamarin demos.

This year, we built the technology stack for a fictional company named SmartHotel360, which allows users to manage their stay at the hotel.

**Note:** This document is about the **Xamarin** apps.

## Projects

There are two different solutions:

- **SmartHotel**: Main project developed with Xamarin.Forms.
- **SmartHotel Maintenance**: Xamarin.iOS Application that allows the maintenance of the hotel. It makes use of **[Forms Embedding](https://blog.xamarin.com/unleashed-embedding-xamarin-forms-in-xamarin-native/)**.
- **SmartHotel NFC**: Unlock door using NFC.

## Supported Platforms: iOS, Android, and Windows

The SmartHotel app is available for three platforms:

- iOS
- Android
- Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

The SmartHotel Maintenance app is available only for iOS.
